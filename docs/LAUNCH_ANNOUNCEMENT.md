### Reddit Announcement (r/fitness, r/webdev, etc.)

**r/fitness Post:**
```
Title: "Just launched a marketing site for my offline-first gym tracker app - would love feedback from the fitness community!"

Hey r/fitness!

I've been working on a gym tracking app called LiftFire that focuses on three things most apps get wrong:

1. **Actually working offline** - tracks everything locally, syncs when connected
2. **Gamification that motivates** - XP, achievements, streaks, challenges
3. **Real social features** - workout with friends, not just share screenshots

Just launched our marketing website at https://liftfire.app and would love feedback from real gym-goers.

**What makes it different:**
• Works 100% offline (tested in basement gyms with zero signal)
• Gamification system that actually keeps you motivated
• Social challenges and leaderboards with friends
• AI insights for plateau detection and form analysis
• Progressive Web App (works on any device)

**Current status:**
• Website just launched (feedback welcome!)
• Mobile app in beta testing
• Planning app store release Q2 2024

I'm particularly interested in:
• Does the website clearly explain the value?
• What features matter most to you?
• Any concerns or questions?

Built this because I was frustrated with apps that don't work in my gym's dead zones. Would love to hear if this resonates with others!

Thanks for checking it out! 💪
